# OpenCV_Computer_Vision
This repository contains a collection of Python scripts and resources that I created while learning and exploring various computer vision techniques and concepts. The goal of this project was to gain hands-on experience with OpenCV, image processing, and deep learning for computer vision tasks.

## Contents

- `basic.py`: Implements basic image operations such as loading, displaying, and saving images.
- `bitwise.py`: Demonstrates bitwise operations and their applications in image processing.
- `color_channels.py`: Explores color channel manipulation and color space conversions.
- `contours.py`: Covers contour detection and analysis techniques.
- `deeplearning.py`: Implements a deep learning model for computer vision tasks.
- `draw.py`: Provides functions for drawing shapes, text, and annotations on images.
- `face_recognize.py`: Performs face recognition using deep learning models.
- `face_trained.yml`: A pre-trained model for face recognition.
- `facedetection.py`: Detects faces in images or video streams using Haar cascades or deep learning models.
- `facerecognition.py`: Recognizes faces in images or video streams using deep learning models.
- `features.npy`: Pre-computed features for face recognition.
- `gradient.py`: Applies gradient-based filtering and edge detection techniques.
- `haar_face.xml`: A Haar cascade classifier for face detection.
- `histograms.py`: Demonstrates histogram-based image analysis and processing.
- `labels.npy`: Labels for the face recognition model.
- `masking.py`: Explores image masking and region-of-interest extraction.
- `read.py`: Functions for reading and displaying images and videos.
- `rescale.py`: Implements image resizing and scaling operations.
- `smooth.py`: Applies various smoothing and blurring techniques to images.
- `spaces.py`: Explores different color spaces and their applications.
- `thresh.py`: Demonstrates thresholding techniques for image binarization and segmentation.
- `transformation.py`: Applies geometric transformations such as rotation, translation, and perspective transformations to images.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you'll need to have Python and OpenCV installed on your system. You can install OpenCV using pip:

```
pip install opencv-python
```

Additionally, some scripts may require other dependencies like NumPy, Matplotlib, or TensorFlow. You can install these packages using pip as well.

Once you have the required dependencies installed, you can clone this repository and explore the scripts. Each script is self-contained and can be run independently.

## Usage

To run a specific script, navigate to the repository directory and execute the script using Python:

```
python script_name.py
```

Some scripts may require additional arguments or input data. You can modify the scripts or provide the necessary inputs as per your requirements.

## Contributing

This repository is primarily for personal learning and exploration purposes. However, if you find any issues or have suggestions for improvements, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
